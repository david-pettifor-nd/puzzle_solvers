About
---
Monthly puzzles posted in the bathrooms of the Information Technology Center (ITC) by the Office of Information Technology (OIT) at the University of Notre Dame
often include puzzles of which are solvable through some sort of programatic solution.  For those, I attempt at solving them with Python scripts.

Usage
---
Each puzzle is provided in the Year/Month subfolder, and includes a screenshot of the actual puzzle, along with the `solver.py` file.  Some scripts require the use
of tools within the `tools` folder, so execution should be done from this root folder.

Example: `python 2017/October/solver.py`
